Description: What is it?
        ===========
        
        *omega|ml is the production and integration platform for data science
        that scales from laptop to teams to enterprise. Batteries included.*
        
        Documentation: https://omegaml.github.io/omegaml/
        
        Features
        ========
        
        *Community Edition*
        
        omega|ml is for you if you want to 
        
        - get a fully integrated data science workplace within minutes [1]
        - easily share models, data, jupyter notebooks and reports with your collaborators
        - perform out-of-core computations on a pure-python or Apache Spark compute cluster [2]
        - have a shared NoSQL database, out of the box, that behaves like a Pandas dataframe [3]
        - deploy models to production with a single line of code
        - use models or datasets from a REST API
        - use a compute cluster to train your models with no additional setup 
        - scale your data science work from your laptop to team to production with no code changes
        
        [1] supporting scikit-learn, Spark MLLib out of the box, Keras and
        Tensorflow available shortly
        [2] using Celery, Dask Distributed or Spark
        [3] using MongoDB
        
        In addition omega|ml provides an easy-to-use extensions API to support any kind of models, compute cluster, database and data source.
        
        *Enterprise Edition*
        
        omega|ml enterprise provides security on every level and is ready made for Kubernetes
        deployment and is licensed separately. Sign up at https://omegaml.io
        
        Get started
        ===========
        
        .. code::
        
            $ wget https://github.com/omegaml/omegaml/blob/master/docker-compose.yml
            $ docker-compose up -d
        	  
        Next open your browser at http://localhost:8899 to open Jupyter Notebook. Any notebook
        you create will automatically be stored within the omega|ml database, thus making it
        easy to work with colleagues. The REST API is available at http://localhost:5000.
        
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        Get more information at https://omegaml.github.io/omegaml/
        
        .. code::
        
            # transparently store Pandas Series and DataFrames or any Python object
            om.datasets.put(df, 'stats')
            om.datasets.get('stats', sales__gte=100)
        
            # transparently store and get models
            clf = LogisticRegression()
            om.models.put(clf, 'forecast')
            clf = om.models.get('forecast')
        
            # run and scale models directly on the integrated Python or Spark compute cluster
            om.runtime.model('forecast').fit('stats[^sales]', 'stats[sales]')
            om.runtime.model('forecast').predict('stats')
            om.runtime.model('forecast').gridsearch(X, Y)
        
            # use the REST API to store and retrieve data, run predictions
            requests.put('/v1/dataset/stats', json={...})
            requests.get('/v1/dataset/stats?sales__gte=100')
            requests.put('/v1/model/forecast', json={...})
